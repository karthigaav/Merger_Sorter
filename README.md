# Merger_Sorter

Project Objective:
This project sorts a set of array data A and sorts a set of array data B and Merges two sorted array. The resulted array would be merged sorted array.

For Example:

If Array A=[55,44,100,22,47,1] and
Array B=[4,3,45,33,22,10]
<ul><li>The Sorter method will sort both the array individually as ascending to decending order and give the results.</li>
<li>The merger method with merge both the arrays and sort</li>
<li>The Main method inializes numbers randomly for array A & array B. Since the Sorter class is implemented using Thread, to execute the array A to get sorted - we can make the object of the sorted class to Sart and to make the Thread to die Join is needed.So, the Main program call the Sorter and Merger class and execute the task.</li>
